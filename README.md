Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch

📌 Overview

This repository contains implementations of fundamental machine learning algorithms from scratch using Python. The algorithms implemented are:

1. Linear Regression

2. Logistic Regression

3. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

4. Lasso Regression

Each algorithm is implemented without using high-level machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn, ensuring a deep understanding of the underlying mathematical concepts.

📊 Implemented Algorithms

1️⃣ Linear Regression

• A supervised learning algorithm used for predicting continuous values. This implementation includes:

• Gradient Descent approach

• Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the loss function

2️⃣ Logistic Regression

• A classification algorithm used for binary classification tasks. This implementation includes:

• Sigmoid activation function

• Binary Cross Entropy loss

• Gradient Descent optimization

3️⃣ K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

• A non-parametric classification algorithm that classifies data points based on their proximity to labeled examples. This implementation covers:

• Euclidean , Manhattan distance calculation

• Weighted voting mechanism
