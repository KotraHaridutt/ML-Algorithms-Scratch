Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch

📌 Overview

This repository contains implementations of fundamental machine learning algorithms from scratch using Python. The algorithms implemented are:

Linear Regression

Logistic Regression

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Lasso Regression

Each algorithm is implemented without using high-level machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn, ensuring a deep understanding of the underlying mathematical concepts.
